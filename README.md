# Project1-1056
## By: David Gonzales

## REQUIREMENTS
Each Student must demonstrate the ability to set up a folder properly and include the necessary Javascript file.<br>
The secondary focus of this assignment is typography on the web. Students will be given copy and a few images (related to<br>
the midterm) to work with. The goal is to prepare students for the midterm project by thinking about how they may handle<br>
typography in their project.<br><br>
Each student is responsible for selecting appropriate fonts (using the techniques covered in class e.g. google fonts or CSS3<br>
@font-face) and CSS styles to enhance the copy. Line Height, Letter Spacing, Font Weight, Colour and Type are the critical<br>
components of this assignment.<br><br>
The text will be placed on a single provided web page (CSS Grid) with no other design elements other than the text and images<br>
provided.<br><br>
Web files must be uploaded to GitHub following best practices taught in Authoring.

## STEPS

I made sure the folder was properly organized, and renamed the images so they were easier to discern while in the text editor.<br>
I then made sure "main.js" was initialized in the head of the html file.<br>
I added the content, using only what was in the "assets" and "images" folder.<br>
I customized the CSS, changing the background, font color, line height, letter spacing, font weight, and font family.<br>
I assumed the initial width of the main container was meant to stay, so I left it as is and capped the width of the images to be 400px.<br>
I am now adding it to GitHub, and making sure I follow all the best GitHub practices taught in Authoring last semester.<br>
