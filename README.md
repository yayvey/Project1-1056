# Project1-1056

## REQUIREMENTS
Each Student must demonstrate the ability to set up a folder properly and include the necessary Javascript file.<br>
The secondary focus of this assignment is typography on the web. Students will be given copy and a few images (related to<br>
the midterm) to work with. The goal is to prepare students for the midterm project by thinking about how they may handle<br>
typography in their project.<br><br>
Each student is responsible for selecting appropriate fonts (using the techniques covered in class e.g. google fonts or CSS3<br>
@font-face) and CSS styles to enhance the copy. Line Height, Letter Spacing, Font Weight, Colour and Type are the critical<br>
components of this assignment.<br><br>
The text will be placed on a single provided web page (CSS Grid) with no other design elements other than the text and images<br>
provided.<br><br>
Web files must be uploaded to GitHub following best practices taught in Authoring.
